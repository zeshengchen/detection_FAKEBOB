# Detection of FAKEBOB (MEH-FEST)
Source code for the paper ["On the Detection of Adaptive Adversarial Attacks in Speaker Verification Systems"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10102918). In this work, we propose a new detector, called Minimum Energy in High FrEquencies for Short Time (MEH-FEST), to distinguish between an original audio and an adversarial audio.

## Reproduce our experiment step by step
1. Follow the instructions at [FAKEBOB GitHub Repo](https://github.com/FAKEBOB-adversarial-attack/FAKEBOB) to generate adversarial audios.
2. Install "**librosa**" python module by running 
    - **pip install 'numpy==1.20'    # required by librosa**
    - **pip install librosa**
3. Copy "**detection_extend.sh**" and "**detection_extend.py**" to be under the root directory of FAKEBOB code.
4. Change the directory name for the folder that contains adversarial audios. For example, change "**./adversarial-audio/gmm-SV-targeted/**" to "**./adversarial-audio/gmm-SV-targeted_epsilon_002/**".
5. Create a new folder for logs, such as "**./logs_gmm_epsilon_002**".
6. Update shell script "**detection_extend.sh**" for "**archi**", "**epsilon**", and the range of "**k**" in the loop. 
7. Run "**./detection_extend.sh**". The detection results can be find in log files under the log folder, such as "**./logs_gmm_epsilon_002/detection_gmm_epsilon_002_extend_min_1_results.txt**".
